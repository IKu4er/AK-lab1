//Empty spaces, what are we living for?
//Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
//Does anybody know what we are looking for?
//Another hero, another mindless crime
//Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
//Hold the line
//Does anybody want to take it anymore?
//
//The show must go on
//Inside my heart is breaking
//My makeup may be flaking
//But my smile, still, stays on
